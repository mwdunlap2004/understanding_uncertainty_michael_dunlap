I think you could answer a lot of questions like how much different agencies spen in a year, or what they spend their money on, but I don't currently see a good way to make a prediction tool off of this. My best guess for a prediction tool would be some way to predict how much each agency is going to spend based on their past trends, if you could make something like that then the stakeholder would be Virginia and likely the companies they have worked with previously. The practical questions this would create would be how do you deal with random or surprise orders. I think the other data you would want would include the five year plans for these agencies, for example if VDOT is planning some massive road construction moves then that would effect the forecast for future sales. That's why I wonder if this would be a good predictive tool, it seems to me that the variables we have wouldn't be super beneficial for a method of creating a forecast of spending."
